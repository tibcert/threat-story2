While incidents of digital espionage against the Tibetan community are well documented in threat intelligence reports, the focus is almost always on the technical aspects alone. These reports have no understanding of the social and political context in which these threats occur. Without this context it is not possible to understand the harm of digital espionage.

Only paying attention to the malware and other technical tricks being used in digital espionage is like investigating a shooting but only analyzing the gun. When gun crime is investigated, the forensic details of the bullet may help connect similar attacks and maybe even trace it to the shooter, but if the damage against the victim and the context in which the attack happened is ignored the nature and impact of the crime cannot be properly assessed. Digital espionage is no different. A full understanding of digital espionage requires a wider and deeper view into the issue. We interviewed members of the Tibet movement who have been targeted by digital espionage to document the history of the threat against the community and show the impact.

## A Movement Under Surveillance
The first line of attack in most digital espionage that uses targeted malware is luring targets to perform some kind of action, usually opening a malicious attachment or link. The social engineering tactics used in these intrusion attempts are often highly sophisticated and show a knowledge of the activities and network of the target. This level of sophistication speaks to the effort being put into the espionage campaigns and the amount of information the adversaries already have on their targets. The stories we collected from community members on the frontline of Tibet advocacy share key moments in the history of the movement. This mirroring reflects the persistence of digital threats over decades and shows how closely the adversaries monitor the community.

## Surveillance, Harassment, And the 2008 Beijing Olympics
In 2008, Beijing played host to the Summer Olympics. The mega event was a major publicity moment for the government of China and accordingly was also a crucial moment to bring attention to human rights abuses in the country.

A wave of protests broke out in Tibet against China’s unceasing violations that undermine the cultural, linguistic, and religious freedom of Tibetans. During this uprising, many Tibetans and Tibet support groups conducted advocacy actions including disrupting the Olympic Torch routes as well as raising awareness of the dire straits inside Tibet on international conferences, events and media platforms.

Kate Woznow was part of this advocacy effort as Campaign Director of Students for a Free Tibet. From Bangkok Thailand, Kate coordinated a flurry of activities including organizing protests and managing media strategies. During this period Skype was a key communications tool for Kate to reach activists across the world from Beijing, London, New York and beyond. These communications were often highly sensitive and Kate and her colleagues took precautions such as using code names to mask their identity. Despite these efforts Kate soon found herself a target of surveillance and harassment.

In July 2008, as the Olympics games opened Kate began to receive suspicious Skype messages. The person on the other end addressed her by her secret code name and also knew the code name for Kate’s colleague Lhadon Tethong, Executive Director of Students for a Free Tibet. The messages were written in a tone to suggest that the person already knew Kate. They asked if she was in Hong Kong and wanted to do an import and export business. The person seemed to be trying to seek out her location and asking about Hong Kong was noteworthy as she had been based there while involved in a 2006 action coordinating a Beijing protest of the railway to Tibet.

The messages left Kate feeling uneasy.

> “The incident was incredibly intimidating, especially during such a critical moment. It had adverse psychological effects, leading me to question my safety constantly. It was truly an eye-opening encounter for me, highlighting the detrimental implications of underestimating such targeted cyber intrusions. Such incidents can put both individuals and their communities at significant risk.”

Later on during the Olympic Games and with the activist protests taking place frequently, another similar incident occurred and the people behind the messages were able to directly message Kate and Lhadon on their Skype code names trying to get in touch with them, indicating that they knew that they were leading the Olympics campaign together.


<blockquote>
	<p>“It was unnerving to have people on my Skype who knew our code names and who seemed determined to seek out our location. It was the kind of thing that really got into my head because it was intimidating and made me question my safety.</p>
	<p>In many ways I think that the psychological effects of this kind of incident is underestimated or not taken into consideration. There was a thuggishness to the tone of the messages that made me feel uncomfortable."

## Spying & Self Immolations In Tibet

In the aftermath of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, turmoil engulfed Tibet, with China imposing a crackdown on the human rights of Tibetans. Beyond those involved in the 2008 protests, Tibetan writers, singers, and educators became prime targets of repression.[^11] Reports from the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) revealed that around 600 Tibetans were detained as political prisoners during this period.[^12]

2009 marked a somber turn for Tibetans when a 20-year-old monk from Kirti monastery named Lobsang Tashi (or Tapey to his friends) self-immolated in protest against Chinese policies. As his body burned in protest Chinese police shot him and put him into custody.[^13]

Tapey was the first Tibetan to self-immolate in modern Tibet. His protest was understood as

a plea for international attention to China’s oppressive measures in Tibet.

Over the next nine years, 159 Tibetans followed this controversial form of protest and self-immolated. Through this act they called for the return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and freedom for Tibet. This unprecedented series of self immolations was a major concern for the Tibet movement asd it showed the measures Tibetans in Tibet were prepared to take to bring attention to the dire human rights situation.

During this time, Lhadon Tethong was Director of the Tibet Action Institute. Like all leaders in the Tibet Movement Lhadon paid close attention to the self-immolations and worked tirelessly to bring international attention to them.

In February 2012, Lhadon received an email from Cheng Li, a notable Chinese-American scholar who was Director of Research at The Brookings Institution, a prestigious Washington DC think tank. In the email, Mr. Li explained to Lhadon that he would be attending an academic conference on religious research in Shanghai and would like to learn more about Tibetan self immolations. The email included a spreadsheet that Mr. Li explained listed Tibetans who had self-immolated since 2009. He asked Lhadon to review the document for him.

On the first read Lhadon felt flattered by the request from a prominent China expert. However, she quickly determined that the email was not sent from the real Cheng Li. A telltale sign was that the email was sent from a suspicious AOL account (chengli.brookings@ aol.com).

As a leader in the Tibet movement Lhadon had become accustomed to receiving emails with malicious files and messages designed to entice her to open them. The constant targeting she experienced made her weary of any messages she received. While these types of emails were routine to Lhadon, this particular message left her feeling vulnerable.
