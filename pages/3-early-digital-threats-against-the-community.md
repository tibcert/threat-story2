One of the earliest documented incidents of digital espionage against the community was reported in September 2003 by Jigme Tsering, a manager of the Tibetan Computer Resource Centre.

<blockquote>
<p>
	“A number of targeted computer viruses circulating via email throughout the Tibetan Government in Exile and Tibetan support groups and related Non-Government Organizations have been discovered or brought to our attention.
</p>
<p>
	These viruses have appeared in a number of variants, indicating a progressive and sustained development process. For example, some were taking advantage of known security loopholes in Microsoft software in order to automatically run and are always personalized to impersonate departmental emails following previous attempts to collect email address lists. One variant analyzed was found to have been sourced from the Yunnan Province in China, and was designed to collect information of an infected computer and send it via email to an address in Beijing.”

Targeted malware delivered as file attachments to email messages is one of the most common digital espionage tactics experienced by the Tibetan community

Targeted malware operations typically consist of the following process: The targeted user receives an email, possibly appearing to be from someone they know with a message—sometimes specific, sometimes generic—that urges the user to open an attachment, usually a PDF or Microsoft Office document or visit a website.

If the user opens the attachment or link with a vulnerable version of software that has been targeted for exploitation and no security mitigations are in place, their device will likely be compromised. A clean version of the document is typically embedded in the malicious file and is opened upon successful exploitation so as not to arouse suspicion of the recipient. Once the user’s computer is compromised, operators can extract documents, email and other data, and possibly move laterally through the compromised network to target other devices.

From the early targeting described by Jigme Tsering, digital espionage has followed the community like a long dark shadow. As threats to the community grew it became clear that Tibetans were not alone in this experience. These threats reflected trends that should resonate with civil society globally.7

The decades of digital espionage against Tibetans has shown that civil society faces the same level of information security threats as major companies and governments, but with far fewer resources to defend against them.

In 2009, the Information Warfare Monitor (a collaboration between the Citizen Lab and the Secdev Group) published the report “Tracking GhostNet.”^9 The investigation started as a probe into key Tibetan organizations to determine if they were compromised by digital espionage. The result was uncovering the GhostNet digital espionage network that compromised not only the Offices of HHDL and other Tibetan groups but also 1,295 computers in 103 countries around the world 30% of which can be labeled as “high value” targets such as Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Embassies. The investigation traced the command and control servers used to issue commands to compromised machines back to locations in China. However, the researchers were unable to conclusively determine the potential role of the government. What was evident is that this network was performing politically motivated espionage targeting both civil society and governments. From the perspective of the Tibetan community the culprit was clear, it was the government of China.

When the GhostNet report was released, there were almost no public reports on digital espionage. In subsequent years public reporting from the Threat Intelligence industry grew considerably and served as marketing material for companies. In general these reports focus on threats to governments and the private sector which represent the customer base of the industry. Civil society is seldom the focus of these reports with an important exception, the Tibetan community

In the Semi-technical report, TibCERT systematically reviewed threat intelligence reports from 2009 to 2022 and found 63 of these reports documented digital espionage against the Tibetan community. These reports were typically done without any involvement of the Tibetan community and the expensive products and services provided by these companies are outside the grasp of Tibetan groups or any civil society community.

The high number of reports focused on the Tibetan community reflects the high volume of targeted espionage campaigns the community experienced. But this volume does not explain how so many companies had access to the data.

This access can be explained by the popularity of VirusTotal in the Tibetan community. VirusTotal is a service that provides malware analysis of files. The free malware analysis reports provided by the service made it a popular tool for Tibetan journalists and human rights groups to check if files they received were malicious. Any files uploaded to VirusTotal are shared to anti virus and threat intelligence companies that pay the service’s subscription fees. The data feed is provided to help companies improve detection of malware and identify threats. As a result a database of malware began to be made available to companies from targeting experienced by the Tibetan community.

The malware used in these campaigns often mirrored digital espionage activities originating from China that target governments and the private sector. Therefore, reporting on Tibetan threats gave companies a way to publicly disclose details about these threats without having to disclose any sensitive incidents or customer data. The result is threats to the Tibetan community have received more attention from threat intelligence companies than any other civil society movement. These reports provide useful technical information and serve as evidence of decades of targeted espionage. However, typically these private sector reports were done without involvement of the Tibetan community and rarely provided any notifications or incident response support to targeted individuals and groups.8 Therefore, while the reports provided value to companies, the Tibetan community did not receive any direct support.
